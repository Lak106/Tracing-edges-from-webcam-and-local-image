This Python project demonstrates various edge detection techniques using the OpenCV library. It provides an easy-to-follow script that showcases three different methods of edge detection: Sobel Edge Detection, Laplacian Edge Detection, and Canny Edge Detection.

### Key Features:

1. **Reading and Resizing Images:** The script starts by reading an image from a file and resizing it for optimal processing.
2. **Sobel Edge Detection:** Implements both horizontal and vertical edge detections using the Sobel operator.
3. **Laplacian Edge Detection:** Demonstrates the use of the Laplacian operator for edge detection.
4. **Canny Edge Detection:** Showcases the popular Canny edge detection algorithm, with adjustable threshold values.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (cv2)

## Setup and Installation

1. **Python Installation:** Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **OpenCV Installation:** Install OpenCV for Python by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
